# Performance & Code Optimisation Update

This document outlines the significant performance and code structure enhancements applied to the HydroCav website. These changes aim to improve load times, maintainability, and overall user experience.

## Summary of Changes

The following key improvements have been implemented:

1.  **Code Splitting & Modularization**:
    *   The monolithic `css/styles.css` was broken down into smaller, feature-based SCSS modules located in `css/modules/` (e.g., `base.scss`, `layout.scss`, `components.scss`, `pages.scss`, `responsive.scss`).
    *   The main `js/main.js` was refactored into JavaScript modules within `js/modules/` (e.g., `navigation.js`, `animations.js`, `form.js`, `lazyload.js`). The main `js/main.js` now serves as an entry point that imports and initializes these modules.

2.  **SCSS Migration**:
    *   All CSS files were converted to SCSS (`.scss`) to enable the use of variables, nesting, mixins, and better organization. The main SCSS file is `css/styles.scss`, which imports all the SCSS modules.

3.  **Build System (Vite)**:
    *   Vite has been configured as the build tool for the project.
    *   It handles SCSS compilation to CSS.
    *   It bundles and minifies JavaScript and CSS for production builds.
    *   It provides a fast development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
    *   Output files are generated in the `dist/` directory.

4.  **Advanced Image Lazy Loading**:
    *   Lazy loading has been implemented for all images site-wide.
    *   The `js/modules/lazyload.js` script manages this, using native `loading="lazy"` where available and falling back to an Intersection Observer.
    *   Images in `index.html` use `src="#"` as a placeholder, with the actual image path in `data-src`.

5.  **Modern Image Formats with Fallback (<picture> Element)**:
    *   All images in `index.html` now use the `<picture>` HTML element.
    *   This allows serving modern image formats like AVIF and WebP to supporting browsers, with a fallback to the original JPG/PNG format for older browsers.
    *   `<source>` elements use `data-srcset` for their respective image formats, which are populated by the `lazyload.js` script.

## Project Structure Changes

Key new or modified directories include:

*   `hydrocav_website_manus/css/modules/`: Contains the new SCSS module files.
*   `hydrocav_website_manus/js/modules/`: Contains the new JavaScript module files.
*   `hydrocav_website_manus/public/`: Vite's public directory, currently housing the `images/` folder. Static assets here are served at the root during development and copied to `dist/` during build.
*   `hydrocav_website_manus/dist/`: The output directory for production builds, generated by Vite. This directory should typically be added to `.gitignore` if not already (though it was added during setup).
*   `hydrocav_website_manus/node_modules/`: Directory where npm packages (like Vite) are installed. Added to `.gitignore`.

## Build and Development Instructions

To work with this project:

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Navigate to the `hydrocav_website_manus/` directory in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This will install Vite and other necessary development dependencies listed in `package.json`.

2.  **Run Development Server**:
    To start the Vite development server with HMR:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    You can then access the website, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

3.  **Build for Production**:
    To create an optimized production build (minified CSS, JS, etc.):
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    The output files will be placed in the `hydrocav_website_manus/dist/` directory.

## Key File Modifications

Apart from the new module files, the following primary files were created or significantly modified:

*   `hydrocav_website_manus/index.html`: Updated to use `<picture>` elements, `data-src`/`data-srcset` attributes for images, and links to the Vite-processed SCSS and JS entry points. Image paths updated to be root-relative (e.g., `/images/logo.png`).
*   `hydrocav_website_manus/vite.config.js`: Configuration file for Vite.
*   `hydrocav_website_manus/package.json`: Added dependencies for Vite and npm scripts for `dev` and `build`.
*   `hydrocav_website_manus/js/main.js`: Now imports and initializes JavaScript modules.
*   `hydrocav_website_manus/js/modules/lazyload.js`: Updated to support `<picture>` elements, `data-srcset`, and native lazy loading.
*   `hydrocav_website_manus/css/styles.scss`: Main SCSS file that imports all SCSS modules. Image paths within SCSS (e.g., background images) updated to be root-relative.

## Important Notes

*   **Image Generation**: This project assumes that AVIF and WebP versions of the images (e.g., `/images/company-overview.avif`, `/images/company-overview.webp`) are available in the `hydrocav_website_manus/public/images/` directory. The generation of these optimized image formats is a separate process that needs to be performed.
*   **Cache-Control Headers**: The task to set `Cache-Control` headers was skipped as it requires server-side configuration (e.g., via `.htaccess`, Nginx/Apache config) and cannot be implemented solely within the project's client-side codebase.

## Accessibility Enhancements (WCAG 2.1 AA Focus)

The project has undergone several updates to improve accessibility, with the goal of aligning with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA. Key improvements include:

*   **Semantic HTML Structure:** Refactored `index.html` to use appropriate landmark elements such as `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<nav>`. This enhances page structure and improves navigation for users of assistive technologies.
*   **ARIA Implementation:** Added ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to interactive components, particularly the mobile navigation menu. This includes roles like `role="button"`, and properties such as `aria-controls`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-label` to provide better context and interactivity for screen reader users.
*   **Visible Focus Indicators:** Implemented global CSS styles using the `:focus-visible` pseudo-class in `css/modules/base.scss`. This ensures that all interactive elements (links, buttons, form inputs, etc.) display a clear and noticeable focus ring when navigated to using a keyboard, improving usability for keyboard-only users.
*   **Image Accessibility:** Reviewed and updated `alt` text for all images within `index.html` to ensure they provide meaningful descriptions for informative images. Decorative images would ideally have empty `alt` attributes (`alt=""`). Added `aria-label` attributes to social media links in the footer that consist only of icons, providing textual descriptions for these controls.
*   **Enhanced Responsiveness:** Tuned typography (font sizes, line heights) and grid layouts in `css/modules/responsive.scss`, specifically for screens with a width of 360px or less. This ensures better readability and usability of content on very small mobile devices.
