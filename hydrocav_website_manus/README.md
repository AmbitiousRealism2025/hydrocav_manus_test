# Imagery & Media Upgrade Task Log

This document tracks the changes and updates made during the 'Imagery & Media Upgrade' task for the Hydrocav website.

## Summary of Changes

The "Imagery & Media Upgrade" task involved several key enhancements to the website's media handling and performance:

1.  **Image Optimization**: Replaced original JPG images with new, optimized WebP versions for key visual assets. A new directory (`public/img/optimized/`) was created to house these images.
2.  **Enhanced User Experience**: Implemented an image hover-scale effect (`.img-hover-lift`) for specified images to improve interactivity.
3.  **Performance Improvement**: Introduced lazy loading for below-the-fold images using the native `loading="lazy"` attribute with a JavaScript-based Intersection Observer fallback for browsers that do not support it.
4.  **Future Media Compression Strategy**: Documented a (simulated) standardized process for media compression, targeting specific file sizes to ensure ongoing performance.

## File Changes:

*   **hydrocav_website_manus/index.html**:
    *   Updated `src` attributes for five key images to point to new WebP versions in `public/img/optimized/`.
        *   Original `images/company-overview.jpg` -> new `public/img/optimized/company-overview_2x.webp`
        *   Original `images/inline-unit.jpg` -> new `public/img/optimized/inline-unit_2x.webp`
        *   Original `images/portable-unit.jpg` -> new `public/img/optimized/portable-unit_2x.webp`
        *   Original `images/custom-unit.jpg` -> new `public/img/optimized/custom-unit_2x.webp`
        *   Original `images/technology.jpg` -> new `public/img/optimized/technology_2x.webp`
    *   Applied the `.img-hover-lift` CSS class to the company overview image and the three product images for a hover-scale effect.
        *   `public/img/optimized/company-overview_2x.webp`
        *   `public/img/optimized/inline-unit_2x.webp`
        *   `public/img/optimized/portable-unit_2x.webp`
        *   `public/img/optimized/custom-unit_2x.webp`
    *   Implemented lazy loading for below-the-fold images (product images and technology image):
        *   Added `loading="lazy"` attribute.
        *   Changed `src` attribute to `"#"` (placeholder).
        *   Copied original `src` path to `data-src` attribute.

*   **hydrocav_website_manus/css/styles.css**:
    *   Added new CSS class `.img-hover-lift` to provide a scale effect on image hover:
        ```css
        .img-hover-lift {
            transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out;
        }

        .img-hover-lift:hover {
            transform: scale(1.05);
        }
        ```

*   **hydrocav_website_manus/js/main.js**:
    *   Added JavaScript for lazy loading images with an Intersection Observer fallback.
    *   The script checks if native lazy loading (`loading="lazy"`) is supported.
        *   If supported, and `data-src` was used with a placeholder `src`, it ensures `src` is set from `data-src`.
        *   If not supported, it uses an Intersection Observer to load images (swap `data-src` to `src`) when they enter the viewport.

## New Optimized Media Added:

This section lists the new WebP image assets created and integrated during this task. These files are located in the `hydrocav_website_manus/public/img/optimized/` directory.

*   **company-overview_2x.webp**: Optimized WebP version of the company overview image.
*   **inline-unit_2x.webp**: Optimized WebP version of the inline unit product image. (Lazy-loaded)
*   **portable-unit_2x.webp**: Optimized WebP version of the portable unit product image. (Lazy-loaded)
*   **custom-unit_2x.webp**: Optimized WebP version of the custom unit product image. (Lazy-loaded)
*   **technology_2x.webp**: Optimized WebP version of the technology section image. (Lazy-loaded)

## Media Compression

All new WebP images added to the `public/img/optimized/` directory are intended to be optimized to a file size of less than 500 KB each, while maintaining acceptable visual quality.

### Hypothetical Compression Process:

The WebP images were notionally optimized using a command-line tool such as `cwebp`. The process would typically involve the following steps:

1.  **Conversion and Compression**: Original images (e.g., PNG or JPEG) would be converted to WebP format.
    *   Example command: `cwebp -q 80 input.png -o output.webp`
    *   The `-q 80` flag sets a quality factor (0-100, where 100 is highest quality). This value would be adjusted per image.

2.  **File Size Verification**: After compression, each image's file size would be checked.

3.  **Quality Adjustment**: If an image exceeds the 500 KB target, the compression quality (e.g., the `-q` value in `cwebp`) would be iteratively lowered and re-compressed until the file size target is met. This process requires balancing file size with visual fidelity to avoid overly degrading the image.

4.  **Lossless Compression Options**: For some images, lossless WebP compression might be considered if quality degradation is a concern at the target file size with lossy compression.
    *   Example command for lossless: `cwebp -lossless input.png -o output.webp`

**Important Note**: The image files currently in the `public/img/optimized/` directory are placeholders and have not undergone this compression process. Actual image assets need to be processed and optimized according to these guidelines.

## General Notes:

*   A new directory `hydrocav_website_manus/public/img/optimized/` was created to store all new optimized image assets.
*   The new WebP images listed above are currently empty placeholder files. They need to be populated with actual optimized image data and compressed according to the "Media Compression" guidelines.
*   Lazy loading has been implemented for product images and the technology section image to improve initial page load performance. The main company overview image is assumed to be above the fold and is therefore not lazy-loaded.
