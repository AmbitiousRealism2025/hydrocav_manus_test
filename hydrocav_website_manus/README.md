# Performance & Code Optimisation Update

This document outlines the significant performance and code structure enhancements applied to the HydroCav website. These changes aim to improve load times, maintainability, and overall user experience.

## Summary of Changes

The following key improvements have been implemented:

1.  **Code Splitting & Modularization**:
    *   The monolithic `css/styles.css` was broken down into smaller, feature-based SCSS modules located in `css/modules/` (e.g., `base.scss`, `layout.scss`, `components.scss`, `pages.scss`, `responsive.scss`).
    *   The main `js/main.js` was refactored into JavaScript modules within `js/modules/` (e.g., `navigation.js`, `animations.js`, `form.js`, `lazyload.js`). The main `js/main.js` now serves as an entry point that imports and initializes these modules.

2.  **SCSS Migration**:
    *   All CSS files were converted to SCSS (`.scss`) to enable the use of variables, nesting, mixins, and better organization. The main SCSS file is `css/styles.scss`, which imports all the SCSS modules.

3.  **Build System (Vite)**:
    *   Vite has been configured as the build tool for the project.
    *   It handles SCSS compilation to CSS.
    *   It bundles and minifies JavaScript and CSS for production builds.
    *   It provides a fast development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
    *   Output files are generated in the `dist/` directory.

4.  **Advanced Image Lazy Loading**:
    *   Lazy loading has been implemented for all images site-wide.
    *   The `js/modules/lazyload.js` script manages this, using native `loading="lazy"` where available and falling back to an Intersection Observer.
    *   Images in `index.html` use `src="#"` as a placeholder, with the actual image path in `data-src`.

5.  **Modern Image Formats with Fallback (<picture> Element)**:
    *   All images in `index.html` now use the `<picture>` HTML element.
    *   This allows serving modern image formats like AVIF and WebP to supporting browsers, with a fallback to the original JPG/PNG format for older browsers.
    *   `<source>` elements use `data-srcset` for their respective image formats, which are populated by the `lazyload.js` script.

## Project Structure Changes

Key new or modified directories include:

*   `hydrocav_website_manus/css/modules/`: Contains the new SCSS module files.
*   `hydrocav_website_manus/js/modules/`: Contains the new JavaScript module files.
*   `hydrocav_website_manus/public/`: Vite's public directory, currently housing the `images/` folder. Static assets here are served at the root during development and copied to `dist/` during build.
*   `hydrocav_website_manus/dist/`: The output directory for production builds, generated by Vite. This directory should typically be added to `.gitignore` if not already (though it was added during setup).
*   `hydrocav_website_manus/node_modules/`: Directory where npm packages (like Vite) are installed. Added to `.gitignore`.

## Build and Development Instructions

To work with this project:

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Navigate to the `hydrocav_website_manus/` directory in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This will install Vite and other necessary development dependencies listed in `package.json`.

2.  **Run Development Server**:
    To start the Vite development server with HMR:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    You can then access the website, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

3.  **Build for Production**:
    To create an optimized production build (minified CSS, JS, etc.):
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    The output files will be placed in the `hydrocav_website_manus/dist/` directory.

## Key File Modifications

Apart from the new module files, the following primary files were created or significantly modified:

*   `hydrocav_website_manus/index.html`: Updated to use `<picture>` elements, `data-src`/`data-srcset` attributes for images, and links to the Vite-processed SCSS and JS entry points. Image paths updated to be root-relative (e.g., `/images/logo.png`).
*   `hydrocav_website_manus/vite.config.js`: Configuration file for Vite.
*   `hydrocav_website_manus/package.json`: Added dependencies for Vite and npm scripts for `dev` and `build`.
*   `hydrocav_website_manus/js/main.js`: Now imports and initializes JavaScript modules.
*   `hydrocav_website_manus/js/modules/lazyload.js`: Updated to support `<picture>` elements, `data-srcset`, and native lazy loading.
*   `hydrocav_website_manus/css/styles.scss`: Main SCSS file that imports all SCSS modules. Image paths within SCSS (e.g., background images) updated to be root-relative.

## Important Notes

*   **Image Generation**: This project assumes that AVIF and WebP versions of the images (e.g., `/images/company-overview.avif`, `/images/company-overview.webp`) are available in the `hydrocav_website_manus/public/images/` directory. The generation of these optimized image formats is a separate process that needs to be performed.
*   **Cache-Control Headers**: The task to set `Cache-Control` headers was skipped as it requires server-side configuration (e.g., via `.htaccess`, Nginx/Apache config) and cannot be implemented solely within the project's client-side codebase.
